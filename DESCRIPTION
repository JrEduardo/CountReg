Description: The gammacount is a package with functions to apply
    regression models to count data using the Gamma-Count distribution.
    A likelihood-based approach is used for parameter estimation and
    inference through a S4 implementation derived from bbmle package.
    The Gamma-count regression model is considered in this package and
    methods for this model are provided.
